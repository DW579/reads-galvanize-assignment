I have included all my files in this git push. I have also included the seeds created to have my table be populated onto the application. Although, I was having trouble launching my application through heroku. It kept throwing me an error that my data tables are corrupted. I need have two problem migrations that I have attempted a few ways to remove, but with no success. I believe this could be the failure and preventing me to launching my application to heroku.
